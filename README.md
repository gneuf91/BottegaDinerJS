Building out the Dinner app but this time in JAVASCRIPT!

# Bottega Diner
# Have a Main Menu, and a Sides Menu
# You get one entree and two side choices at regular cost.
# - show them the entire menu (print out)
# - User selects an entree.
# - “Waitress” makes a comment based on their selection
# - comment can either be a comparison of the two items, or random comment pulled from a comment vault.
# - Tell them the price
# - repeat the above options for side choices (suggestion and a price, don’t repeat chef suggestion)
# - total up the cost
BONUS
# Have a breakfast, lunch and dinner menu.  Breakfast has different items, lunch and dinner have the same items but are different prices.
# BONUS: Allow for item customization (how items are prepared, decide additional cost implications)
